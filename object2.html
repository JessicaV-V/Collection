       <p> I took this picture one morning waking up. It was spectacular. I couldn’t help myself to not take the picture. This was taken from the back of my apartment. For a moment, time stood still and it was just beautiful and magical. Yes, I live next to a cemetary but that’s ok. I just wish I could have gotten to the falls in time for a picture.
